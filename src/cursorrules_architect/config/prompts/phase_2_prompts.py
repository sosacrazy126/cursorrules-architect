modifying the core logic of the agents.

PHASE_2_PROMPT = """You are a project documentation planner tasked with processing the <initial_findings>...</initial_findings> from the given <project_structure>...</project_structure> in order to:

1. Create a listing of a team of 3 to 5 agents that would be the best fit to analyze the contents of each file shown within the project structure.

2. Assign each file to the applicable agent you created until all files have been assigned.

# Approach

- Agent Creation: Identify roles and expertise suitable for the project's needs.

- File Assignment: Distribute files based on agent expertise to ensure efficient analysis.

# 2. DO NOT use special characters like &, <, > in agent names or descriptions
# 3. Use only alphanumeric characters and spaces in names
# 4. Keep agent IDs exactly as shown: agent_1, agent_2, agent_3)
