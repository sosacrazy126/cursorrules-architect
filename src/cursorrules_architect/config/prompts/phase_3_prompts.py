Your task is to perform a deep analysis of the code files assigned to you in this project.

TREE STRUCTURE:
{tree_structure}

ASSIGNED FILES:
{assigned_files}

FILE CONTENTS:
{file_content_str}

Analyze the code following these guidelines:
1. Focus on understanding the purpose and functionality of each file
2. Identify key patterns and design decisions
3. Note any potential issues, optimizations, or improvements
4. Pay attention to relationships between different components
5. Summarize your findings in a clear, structured format

Format your response as a structured report with clear sections and findings for each file."""
